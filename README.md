## Overview

This will be my sixth challenge completed on Frontend Mentor, and it was by far the easiest for me as I'm feeling much more confident in my HTML and CSS skills and knowledge base.

I had a lot of fun styling the active states on this challenge, as well as delving much deeper into my media queries to get the final results as close to the provided examples as possible.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow
- Visual Studio Code

### What I learned

In this challenge I made sure to use <main> after the <body> as opposed to a <div>. I also utilized the <h1> and <h2> elements in a way that follows the correct syntax and best practice.

### Continued development

HTML5, CSS, Javascript, React, Python, & Vue.js

### Useful resources

- [Thomas Sankara](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3n22cowxoKU) - Mr. Sankara's video tutorial was very help for this challenge. I started out by coding the entire challenge on my own and then watch this video to go review and apply changes where needed. *this video does not show the active state of the box-shadow*
